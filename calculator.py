#Appears someone did the homework and merged it to main, however, I changed it and am getting error messages, so I am getting some extra practice
#It is saying that there are functions: sqaure(), test_sqaure(), cube(), and test_cube() that are not defined. However I am not seeing them in this.
#added these functions, also revered the define function to a and b. as I am defining desired relationship between a and b and not the relationship between specific numbers. I am essesntially telling the computer that "multiply" entails taking a *b
